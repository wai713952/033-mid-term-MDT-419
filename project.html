                    Hounted Goose is a retro-graphic style horror game made by Unity. 
                    The player needs to run away from the goose-like monster that 
                    haunted the abandoned factory. 
                    My role in making this game is creating the story, 
                    game event, 3D models, scene decoration, monster’s 
                    animation, and soundtrack. There is also an enhanced 
                    graphic trailer of this video game. Hounted Goose full 
                    version can be download for free at GameJolt.com or watch 
                    the gameplay video on YouTube by searching the name.

                    different playstyle and abilities. The players will level 
                    up by gaining the experience and crystal(currency) through
